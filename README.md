## 🧩 Problem Statement 

AtliQ Mart, a leading retail chain in South India, runs multiple promotional campaigns throughout the year to boost product sales and drive footfall to stores. During the festive periods of **Diwali 2023** and **Sankranti 2024**, the company invested significantly in various types of promotions across different stores and product categories.

However, after the campaigns ended, the Sales and Marketing leadership lacked **clear and consolidated insights** on:

- Which **stores** generated the most revenue from promotions?
- Which **promotion types** (Discount, Cashback, BOGOF) were most effective?
- How did **product performance** vary by promotion type?
- Were there **regional trends**, such as certain states or cities responding better to specific types of offers?
- Did these promotions lead to **actual sales uplift**, or simply discount-driven churn?

Without these insights, it is difficult for the company to:

- Justify the **ROI** of their campaigns
- **Optimize future promotional budgets**
- Develop **personalized promotion strategies** per region or product

This dashboard project was initiated to bridge that gap. Using structured data from the company’s transactional database and metadata from products, stores, and campaigns, we performed a comprehensive analysis and presented the results through an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.

|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales uplift metrics not directly available                 | Created derived metrics (IR, ISU, lift) using SQL and formulae           |
| Handling orientation and missing args in bar charts         | Adjusted Plotly `orientation`, fixed required arguments                  |
| Interpreting promo vs product response across categories    | Created category-promotion matrix to visualize correlation               |
| Ensuring dynamic filters didn’t break charts                | Used default `sort_values` and included error handling                   |
